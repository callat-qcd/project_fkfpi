Python binding of chiron functions
==================================


Requires:

	1) pybind11	--	header-only library, i.e. if not yet available
 				just download and put somewhere
	2) chiron	--	both static libraries (libchiron.a and
				libjbnumlib.a) are required

		Before building those libraries, in Chiron's Makefile, make
		the following changes:

			a) add `-fPIC' to CFLAGS
			b) remove `$(INCLUDECHIRON)' in the line starting with
			   `ar r libchiron.a' building libchiron.a
			c) remove `include/jbnumlib.h' in the line starting with
			   `ar r libjbnumlib.a' building libjbnumlib.a


Building python module:

	-) In build.sh, adjust the paths to PYBIND and CHIRON
	-) Execute build.sh
	-) This should create a chiron.xxxxx.so file, which can be imported
		in Python
