Changes compared to v0.50:
Note dates are in yymmdd format (Swedish and ISO standard)

141203:
in Makefile: added -L./lib in compiling the test versions
in src/finitevolumeoneloopintegrals.cc;
      "src/besselonesum.cc" -> "besselonesum.cc"
    (Sergiy Ivashin pointed out that the setup of v0.50 might not work
     everywhere)

141217
added the sunset integrals for the partially quenched results:
quenchedsunsetintegrals.h
quenchedsunsetintegrals.cc 
testquenchedsunsetintegrals.cc 
testquenchedsunsetintegrals.dat
comparequenchedsunsetfortran.dat

141218
manual started, jbnumlib part finished:
manual.tex

141219
changed with lomass and quarkmass added as classes for inputs affects:
inputs.cc
inputs.h 
testinputs.cc
testinputs.dat

141222
quarkmassnf added as possible inputs:
inputsnf.cc
inputsnf.h
testinputsnf.cc
testinputsnf.dat
Linf: the Li for nf flavours, includes L11 so partially quenched two-flavour
is possible:
Linf.h
Linf.cc
testLinf.cc
testLinf.dat
Ki: the Ki for nf flavours, uses Linf:
Ki.h
Ki.cc
testKi.cc
testKi.dat

150107
A number of real and complex integration routines added and included in manual:
jbdgauss2.cc
jbdquad15.cc
jbdquad21.cc
jbdcauch2.cc
jbdsing15.cc
jbdsing21.cc
jbwgauss2.cc
jbwquad15.cc
jbwquad21.cc
testing real integration routines:
testintegralsreal.cc
testintegralsreal.dat
testintegralsrealsingular.cc
testintegralsrealsingular.dat
testing complex integration routines:
testintegralscomplex.cc
testintegralscomplex.dat
A macro WINTEGRAL has been defined in oneloopintegrals.cc to allow for
an easy change of complex integration routines, also from the compile lines
Macros DINTEGRAL,SINTEGRAL have been defined in sunsetintegrals.cc to allow for
an easy change of real integration routines with and without singularity,
also from the compile lines

150109
Things defined in inputs.h and Li.h added to the manual

150119
Things defined in Ci.h added to manual

150120
Tadpoles order epsilon added
oneloopintegrals.cc
oneloopintegrals.h

added the macro DINTEGRAL for the real integration routine also to
quenchedsunsetintegrals.cc
(Partially) quenched sunsetintegrals added to manual.

150122
added the macro DINTEGRAL for the real integration routine also to
finitevolumeoneloopintegrals.cc

150123
Finite volume tadpoles added to manual
